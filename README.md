# Ultimatrix

**AI-Powered Autonomous Security Operator** — Single-agent loop that explores, maps, analyses, and attacks web applications. The LLM crafts every payload dynamically based on response analysis. No canned payload lists, no fixed pipeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Interactive setup (writes ultimatrix.yaml)
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts init

# Full assessment — auto-explore then attack
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts assess -t https://your-app.com -o ./output
```

---

## Modes

### `assess` — Full assessment (primary entry point)

Two-phase operation:

**Phase 1 — Automated Exploration (pre-map):** BFS crawl with Playwright. Intercepts all HTTP traffic via `page.route()`. Captures DOM before/after every click and form submit. Correlates network requests with DOM transitions to build the workflow graph automatically.

**Phase 2 — LLM Attack:** The agent starts with a pre-mapped workflow graph (nodes, edges, endpoints, forms, auth boundaries, classified parameters). It reads the map and attacks known endpoints with crafted payloads — no blind re-exploration needed.

```bash
# Basic
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com -o ./output

# With automated exploration (default depth=2)
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com -o ./output --depth 3

# Skip exploration for fast re-scans
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com -o ./output --skip-explore

# Pre-populate from existing artifacts
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com -o ./output \
  --with-openapi ./api-spec.yaml \
  --with-har ./session.har \
  --with-postman ./collection.json \
  --with-src ./src

# Live dashboard
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com -o ./output --dashboard

# Dry-run validation (checks browser + target + OAST, no agent)
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com --dry-run

# Interactive learning mode: crawl + record user flows
ultimatrix assess --learn -t https://target.com -o ./output

# Limit tool calls (default 50)
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com --max-calls 100

# Keep browser open after assessment for inspection
ultimatrix assess -t https://target.com --keep-browser
```

### `verify` — Re-run findings against new deployment

Replays exact same payloads against a fresh target, classifies each finding as fixed/regressed/unchanged.

```bash
ultimatrix verify -a ./output/app-model.json -t https://new-deployment.com
```

### `interact` — Live REPL chat loop with manual recording

Start a chat session with the LLM agent. Use `/record start` to toggle manual browser interaction — the visible Playwright window opens so you can click, type, and navigate directly.

```bash
ultimatrix interact -t https://target.com
```

### `init` — Interactive config wizard

```bash
ultimatrix init
```

---

## Automated Exploration (Pre-Map Phase)

When `--depth N` (default 2) is specified during `assess`, Ultimatrix performs a fully automated crawl before the LLM gets involved:

1. **Network interception:** Every request/response is captured via Playwright `page.route()` — method, URL, status, headers, bodies, timing.
2. **DOM snapshots:** Before and after every interaction (click, form fill, submit), the full page state is captured: URL, title, forms, interactive elements, text content.
3. **Hash-based diffing:** DOM hashes are compared to detect real state changes. If the DOM didn't change, the interaction is skipped.
4. **Context-aware form filling:** Fields are auto-filled with realistic test data based on field name, type, and placeholder (e.g., `email` → `test@example.com`, `price` → `100`).
5. **BFS queue:** New URLs discovered during crawl are added to a breadth-first queue with depth tracking.

The result is a complete workflow graph (nodes + edges) + discovered endpoints + forms + auth boundaries + parameter classifications — all pre-populated in `app-model.json` before the LLM sees it.

## App Model (Knowledge Graph)

The agent's persistent memory is a structured JSON file (`app-model.json`) with 18 sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `target` | Target URL |
| `techStack` | Detected technologies |
| `auth` | Auth type, login endpoint, cookies, tokens, sessions |
| `workflow` | Nodes (pages/APIs) + Edges (transitions) — the state machine |
| `endpoints` | Known API routes with params, methods, response patterns |
| `forms` | Form inputs found on each page |
| `scripts` | External JS loaded on pages |
| `cookies` | Active cookies |
| `localStorage` | LocalStorage values |
| `findings` | Vulnerabilities found with structured evidence |
| `verifications` | Re-run results from `verify` command |
| `parameterClassifications` | What each parameter is FOR (id, email, price, etc.) |

| `hypotheses` | Things to test next |
| `nextSteps` | Ordered action plan |
| `visitedUrls` | URLs already visited |

## Architecture

```
assess → [Pre-map Phase] → [Agent Phase] → [Report]
                        │                 │
                        ▼                 ▼
            BFS crawler            LLM single-agent loop
            Network interception    explore→analyze→attack
            DOM diffing            50 tool-call budget
            Auto form filling      Dashboard events
            Workflow graph build   Auto-report compilation
```

- **Single-agent loop:** THREAT_MODEL_PROMPT drives explore→analyze→attack→re-analyze. No sub-agents. Agent reads/writes `app-model.json` via `read_app_model`/`update_app_model` tools.
- **45 tools** total: browser (19), network (3), exploit (2), recon (5), knowledge (3), app-model (2), session-pool (4), utility (6).
- **11 LLM providers** via @langchain: OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, Groq, Together, Mistral, NIM, OpenRouter, Mock.
- **BrowserSession:** Persistent Playwright sessions with `fill()` contenteditable/JS fallback, `pressKey()`, extraction, `addCookie()`, `hasSession()`, `saveStorageState()`/`loadStorageState()`, recording + replay + manual recording, network trace.
- **AppModel type** (18 sections): workflow graph, recorded sessions, parameter classifications, auth boundaries, structured evidence, risk scoring, report compilation.
- **Auto-report:** `compileReport()` generates HTML, JSON, or Markdown from app model findings — even if the LLM never calls `write_file`. Always written after agent completes.
- **Dashboard:** Optional WebSocket + HTML server (`--dashboard` flag). Streams real-time tool calls, risk changes, status, and errors.
- **Verification:** `verify` command re-runs findings against a fresh deployment, classifies each as fixed/regressed/unchanged/unknown.
- **OAST server:** Local HTTP callback server for blind payload detection (XSS, SSRF, SQLi, XXE). Auto-starts before agent.
- **Triage:** Rule-based evidence scoring (0-7), dedup, auto-severity calibration. Runs after agent finishes.
